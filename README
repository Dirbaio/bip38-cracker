# bip38-cracker

brute-force cracker for casascius's BIP38 cracking contest, details here:

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=128699.0

-----

# Usage

- build libccoin inside of picocoin. I have removed the requirements to build the frontend, so it doesn't need a bunch of dependencies. I believe only openssl and glib. The bip38-cracker Makefile references libccoin.a .

    # cd picocoin
    # ./configure ; make
    # cd ..

- build the main cracker binary.
   
    # ./configure ; make

- run the cracker

    # ./cracker [optional starting string]

----

# Note

- This probably leaks a bunch of memory and has a lot of bugs. For reference only.
- The default implementation uses a key that decrypts with the password AaAaJ, so you can see how it runs without spending lots of time scrypt()ing.
